# library

This is a simple library written in java.  The main data structures in the project are two arraylists, one of which contains all items in the 
library system while the other conatins the items currently avaiable for checkout.  Books and movies are created throguh an item factory, 
making it easy to add DVDs, CDs, etc to the library without changing much code.  The main method consits of a while loop and a switch statement.

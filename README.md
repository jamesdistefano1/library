# library

This is a simple library written in java.  The main data structures in the project are two arraylists, one of which contains all items in the 
library system while the other contains the items currently available for checkout.  Books and movies are created through an item factory, 
making it easy to add DVDs, CDs, etc to the library without changing much code.  The main method consists of a while loop and a switch statement.
